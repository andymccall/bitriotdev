This is a simple app that I've written in eZ80 assembly language for the Agon Light 2.  It will be used as a splash screen for any other applications or games that I write, and for building and improving my Agon Light 2 assembly API.

## Instructions

Run the program from Agon MOS by executing it, `/ * bitriotdev`.  Once started you'll be presented with a menu at the bottom of the screen.

| Key  | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| C  | Clear the screen  |
| F  | Full screen splash  |
| S  | Small screen splash |
| Q  | Quit |

This will give you options to display the splash either full screen or small screen, as shown below:

### Full Screen
